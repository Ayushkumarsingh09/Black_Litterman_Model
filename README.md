# Black Litterman Model
# Black-Litterman Model Implementation

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the Black-Litterman Model, a financial portfolio optimization framework. The model integrates market equilibrium with subjective investor views, offering a robust and practical approach to constructing diversified portfolios.

## Features

- **Implied Equilibrium Returns Calculation**: Compute the equilibrium returns based on market capitalization weights.
- **Integration of Investor Views**: Incorporate absolute and relative views into the model to adjust the equilibrium returns.
- **Black-Litterman Expected Returns**: Derive adjusted returns combining equilibrium and investor views.
- **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)**: Optimize portfolio weights using the adjusted returns.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of portfolio weights and expected returns.
